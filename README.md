# Auto Backup Restore of RDS Instance & Redshift Cluster When EC2 is turned on or off.
This is a Python script that can be used to either back up or restore an RDS instance and Redshift cluster when the EC2 instance is turned on or off. In our application, we use on-demand RDS instances and Redshift clusters that are charged on an hourly basis. However, as we do not require these resources 24/7 during the development phase, we have developed a Lambda function using Python that can create the most recent snapshot and delete the RDS instance or Redshift cluster when the EC2 instance is turned off. Additionally, the Lambda function can create the RDS instance or Redshift cluster from the most recent snapshot when the EC2 instance is turned on. We have created a Lambda function and configured it to be invoked using CloudWatch rules.
